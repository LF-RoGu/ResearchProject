# ResearchProject

This repository collects resources for experiments in mmWave radar and IMU-based sensing. It includes CAD models, planning documents, Python code, and data logs used to test object detection and sensor fusion methods.

## Directory Overview

- **01_Planning** – Spreadsheets and diagrams outlining project tasks and sensor-fusion architecture.
- **02_Models** – SolidWorks models for sensors, mounts, and microcontroller mockups.
- **03_Code** – Python modules for decoding sensor data, clustering detections, building occupancy grids, and combining radar with IMU information.
- **04_Logs** – CSV logs from field experiments, organized by recording session.
- **05_test** – Experimental scripts and prototypes kept for reference.
- **06_PresentationUpdates** – Slide decks tracking project progress.

A typical workflow records radar and IMU data, processes it with the scripts in `03_Code`, and reviews results using the logs in `04_Logs`. See the README in each folder for details.
