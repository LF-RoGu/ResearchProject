# 09_Images Guide

This directory stores every visual asset that appears in the documentation. The headline graphics used in the root
`README.md` are the following PNGs:

1. `ProjectSummaryIntegration.png` – block diagram that shows how the Raspberry Pi 5 collects data from each sensor.
2. `ProjectSensorHighlights.png` – photo identifying where each sensor is installed on the vehicle platform.
3. `Project3DModels.png` – overview graphic pointing to the most relevant CAD renders.
4. `CppImplementationOverview.png` – high-level schematic of the C++ data-processing pipeline.

Feel free to replace or update any of these files (PNG/JPG/SVG are all fine). If you change a filename, remember to update
the corresponding links in the main `README.md` so the visuals continue to render correctly.
