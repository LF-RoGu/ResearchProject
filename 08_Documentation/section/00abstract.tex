\begin{abstract}
This paper explores the integration of mmWave radar technology for object detection and environmental perception of an emergency braking system, a topic that has gained significant attention in autonomous systems and Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS).
An implementation of an emergency braking system for an electric go-kart is presented with a focus on the system's conception and how a processing pipeline for cluster-based detection of static objects can be developed.

The presented approach leverages point-cloud data of a IWR6843AOP mmWave radar sensor from Texas Instruments, processed by a modular pipeline to detect and track objects within a 10-meter range.
This modular pipeline features a radar-only self-speed estimation together with the combination of a specialized filtering stage and a two-stage clustering technique, effectively implementing a lightweight and simple framework for detecting static targets from a moving vehicle.
Its output is used to trigger an emergency braking event which effects the go-kart's braking system through a hardware interface.
